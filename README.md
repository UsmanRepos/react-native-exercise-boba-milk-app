# react-native-exercise-boba-milk-app
This repository contains the source code for a Boba Milk Tea app built with React Native. The app allows users to order various types of boba milk tea, customize their orders with different toppings and flavors, and view their order history. It is a great exercise in building a cross-platform mobile application using React Native.
